The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

And the final data diagram looks like this:

# First step and GOAl of this repository: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building the first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Usage

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id)| ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)```
Show all objects, or all instances of a class | ```(hbnb) all``` or ```(hbnb) all <class>```
Update an attribute of an object | ```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")```

Non-interactive mode example

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
```

## Models

The folder [models](./models/) contains all the classes used in this project.

File | Description | Attributes
---- | ----------- | ----------
[base_model.py](./models/base_model.py) | BaseModel class for all the other classes | id, created_at, updated_at
[user.py](./models/user.py) | User class for future user information | email, password, first_name, last_name
[amenity.py](./models/amenity.py) | Amenity class for future amenity information | name
[city.py](./models/city.py) | City class for future location information | state_id, name
[state.py](./models/state.py) | State class for future location information | name
[place.py](./models/place.py) | Place class for future accomodation information | city_id, user_id, name, description, number_rooms, number_bathrooms, max_guest, price_by_night, latitude, longitude, amenity_ids
[review.py](./models/review.py) | Review class for future user/host review information | place_id, user_id, text

## File storage

The folder [engine](./models/engine/) manages the serialization and deserialization of all the data, following a JSON format.

A FileStorage class is defined in [file_storage.py](./models/engine/file_storage.py) with methods to follow this flow:
```<object> -> to_dict() -> <dictionary> -> JSON dump -> <json string> -> FILE -> <json string> -> JSON load -> <dictionary> -> <object>```

The [__init__.py](./models/__init__.py) file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called **storage**, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance.
This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.

## Tests

All the code is tested with the **unittest** module.
The test for the classes are in the [test_models](./tests/test_models/) folder.
